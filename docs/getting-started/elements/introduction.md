# Elements

Elements provides a component for embedding API reference documentation into any existing CMS, website or React application. Here are some of the features it supports:

- OpenAPI v2 (Swagger), v3.0, v3.1 and beyond
- Interactive "try it" (API Console)
- Beautiful display of complex schemas, requests and responses
- Embeddable
- Multiple layouts

Check out the demo for a live example https://elements-demo.stoplight.io.

> Elements can be used on your local machine and in a production environment completly for free, no strings attached.

## Next steps

Integrating Elements into any project is a case of loading up some JavaScript and CSS, and embedding a Web Component (custom HTML) into the HTML of whatever existing documentation you have. 

This will work with pretty much any CMS: Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress, Jekyll, they will all allow custom HTML to be embedded, and this approach is supported by [pretty much all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1).
